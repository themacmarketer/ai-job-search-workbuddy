# Cover Letter Templates and Tailoring Guide

## Template: Custom cover.cls (XeLaTeX)

Cover letters use a custom LaTeX document class (`cover.cls`) with Lato/Raleway fonts.

**Output file:** `cover_letters/cover_<company>_<role>.tex`
**Compile with:** XeLaTeX (cover.cls requires fontspec)
**Font directory:** `cover_letters/OpenFonts/fonts/`

### Compile command

```bash
cd cover_letters && xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode cover_<company>_<role>.tex
```

Expected output: `Output written on cover_<company>_<role>.pdf (1 page, ...)`. Any page count other than 1 is a failure that must be fixed before presenting to the user.

## Compile-and-Inspect Loop (MANDATORY)

After writing the cover letter and before presenting to the user, always compile and visually inspect the PDF. Iterate until the layout is clean:

1. Run `xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode cover_<company>_<role>.tex`
2. Confirm page count is exactly 1 and compile succeeded
3. Read the PDF via the Read tool and visually check: signature fits at the bottom, no text cut off, bullet font matches body

### Known template pitfall: itemize inside `\lettercontent{}`

The `\lettercontent{}` macro appends `\\` to its argument. This breaks when the argument ends in `\end{itemize}` because `\\` has no line to break after the environment closes, producing `! LaTeX Error: There's no line here to end.` and no PDF output.

**Wrong (breaks compile):**
```latex
\lettercontent{Here is how my experience maps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ...
\end{itemize}}
```

**Correct — close `\lettercontent{}` before the list and wrap the list in the matching Raleway-Medium font so typography stays consistent:**
```latex
\lettercontent{Here is how my experience maps:}

{\raggedright\fontspec[Path = OpenFonts/fonts/raleway/]{Raleway-Medium}\fontsize{11pt}{13pt}\selectfont
\begin{itemize}
    \item ...
\end{itemize}\par}
\vspace{6pt}

\lettercontent{[next paragraph]}
```

The font wrapper is mandatory — if you just move `\begin{itemize}` outside `\lettercontent{}` without the `\fontspec` block, bullets render in the default body font (Lato) and visually mismatch the rest of the letter.

## Singapore market conventions — read before drafting

<!-- LOCALISED: Singapore. -->

### Spelling, date and salutation

- **British English throughout** — `organisation`, `programme`, `specialise`, `analyse`.
  Mixed spelling is the single most common tell that a letter was not written for this market.
- **Date:** `20 October 2026` (day month year). `\currentdate{\today}` renders
  `October 20, 2026` by default, which reads American. Write the date explicitly instead.
- **Salutation:** name the person when the posting names one. Otherwise `Dear [Company] Hiring Team,`
  is better than `Dear Sir/Madam` — Singapore's market skews informal-modern in tech and
  formal in finance, and "Hiring Team" works in both.
- **Closing:** `Yours sincerely,` when you named the recipient; `Kind regards,` is also
  widely used and acceptable in Singapore business correspondence. Avoid `Yours faithfully,`
  unless the letter opens `Dear Sir/Madam`.

### Length and register

- **One page, 250–300 words.** Singapore cover letters are shorter than the European norm.
  A letter that runs to two pages is usually not read to the end.
- **Direct, specific, no preamble.** Open with the role and the single strongest reason to
  read on. Do not open with "I am writing to apply for…" — the subject line already says that.
- **Evidence over adjectives.** One concrete number beats three claims of "proven track record".
- **No em-dashes** (the template's existing rule) — in Singapore business writing this
  reads as an AI or American stylistic import.

### The two Singapore-specific facts worth including

1. **Work-pass position**, when the candidate needs sponsorship or holds a pass. One
   clause, factual, in the second paragraph:
   `I hold an Employment Pass and can start without a new application.` or
   `I would require Employment Pass sponsorship for this role.`
   Recruiters screen for this early; leaving it out invites a clarifying email that many
   will not send.

2. **Notice period and availability**, if the posting or portal asks. `I can start after a
   one-month notice period` is standard Singapore phrasing — one month is the market norm,
   up to three for senior roles.

### What to leave out

- No photo, age, date of birth, marital status or NRIC — same reasoning as the CV.
- No "I am a hardworking team player" opening. Singapore recruiters read a lot of these.
- No salary figure unless the posting explicitly asks for one. If it does, put it in the
  application form, not the letter, and see `08-application-forms.md` for how to frame it.

## Document Structure

\begin{itemize}

\lettercontent{[Connection to company - why this role, why this company specifically]}

\lettercontent{[Personal fit paragraph - behavioral strengths, team contribution, 2-3 sentences]}

\lettercontent{I look forward to hearing from you.}

\begin{flushright}
% No trailing \\ inside \closing{} - cover.cls appends its own \\, and a
% doubled break triggers "! LaTeX Error: There's no line here to end."
\closing{Kind regards,}

\signature{Raymond Chia Kok Leong}
\end{flushright}
\end{document}
```

## Key Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `\namesection{}{Name}{contact info}` | Header with name and contact |
| `\currentdate{date}` | Date field (use `\today` or explicit date) |
| `\lettercontent{text}` | Body paragraph (adds spacing after) |
| `\closing{text}` | Closing line |
| `\signature{name}` | Printed name below signature |

## Tailoring Guidelines

### Salutation
- If you know the hiring manager's name: "Dear [First Last],"
- If you know the team: "Dear [Company] hiring team,"
- Generic: "Dear [Company]," (avoid "To whom it may concern")

### Length - Hard 1-Page Limit
- Target: 1 page including signature block
- Maximum: **never exceed 1 page**
- **Word budget: 250-300 words** of body text (not counting LaTeX markup). This is the safe maximum. 350 words will overflow.
- **Always count**: opening paragraph + bullet list paragraph + closing paragraph = 3 blocks. Add a 4th only if the others are short.
- When adding company-specific content, trim other content to compensate rather than adding net length

### Line Spacing
- Add `\usepackage{setspace}` and `\setstretch{1.0}` if the letter is long and needs to fit on one page
- Use `\vspace{.5cm}` between major sections for readability (only if space permits)

### Bullet Lists
- Place `\begin{itemize}...\end{itemize}` **outside** a `\lettercontent{}` block (see "Known template pitfall" above), wrapped in the matching Raleway-Medium `\fontspec` so the bullet font matches the body
- 3-5 bullets is ideal
- Start each bullet with bold label or action verb
- Use `\textbf{Label:}` for category-style bullets
- A bullet whose text begins with a literal `[` must be braced: `\item {[text]}`. Unbraced, LaTeX parses `[text]` as `\item`'s optional label and renders it off the left page edge, missing from the PDF text layer entirely

### LaTeX Special Characters
Escape these wherever they appear in body text:
- Ampersand: `\&` (company names: Brüel \& Kjær, H\&M) - unescaped, the compile fails loudly
- Percent: `\%` ("grew revenue 30\%") - unescaped, it does **not** fail: everything after the `%` on that line is silently eaten as a LaTeX comment
- Dollar: `\$`, hash: `\#`, underscore: `\_`
- Tilde: `\textasciitilde{}`, caret: `\textasciicircum{}`, backslash: `\textbackslash{}`

### Non-English Cover Letters
- Same template structure, just write content in the posting's language
- Adjust date format to local convention
- Adjust closing to local convention (e.g. "Yours sincerely," for British/Singapore English)

## Checklist Before Finalizing
- [ ] No em-dashes (use commas or periods instead)
- [ ] No cliches or empty filler
- [ ] Every claim backed by specific example
- [ ] Forward-looking framing: focuses on tasks you'll solve, not just past duties
- [ ] Motivation section references this specific company's mission/values
- [ ] Company name and role are correct throughout
- [ ] Date is current
- [ ] Fits on one page
- [ ] Language matches the job posting language
- [ ] Salutation is appropriate (named person if possible)
- [ ] Headline is engaging and specific, not generic

## Submission Guidelines (Best Practice)
- Submit only the documents the employer requests
- Export as PDF to preserve formatting
- Name files clearly: "[Your Name] CV" and "[Your Name] Cover Letter"
- Follow all employer instructions regarding anonymity or specific materials
